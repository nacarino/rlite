- flow entries in ALLOCATED state but never associated to a file descriptor
  with a bind operation should disappear after a while, otherwise we
  have leakage

- rlite-utils: deserialization routines should check lengths

- support generic RIB M_READ (and M_WRITE)

- implement utility to graphically show ipcp-rib-show, using graphviz
  (DIF map with active links)

- install: don't overwrite config files

- DTCP: RTT estimate should happen using ktime_t variables
- DTCP: implement A timer and coalesced ACKs
