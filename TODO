- flow entries in ALLOCATED state but never associated to a file descriptor
  with a bind operation should disappear after a while, otherwise we
  have leakage

- rlite-utils: deserialization routines should check lengths

- if we lose initial PDU containing the DRF, it's a mess, even in presence
  of retransmissions. From an EFCP point of view, in facto, how do I manage
  subsequent packets (that come before the transmitter realizes it needs
  to retransmit the first PDU with the DRF set)? It would be silly dropping
  all these packets. To solve this problem, it could be convenient to
  introduce in the DTP a state flag "waitingForDRF", that forces the DRF
  when this is present but it shouldn't

- CDAP: support a simple retransmission mechanism, in case the CDAP
  connection is not supported by a reliable flow

- support generic RIB M_READ (and M_WRITE)

- shim-inet4: use recvfrom(MSG_PEEK) to support UDP

- BUG (normal): if name X is registered on node A, and someone tries to
  register the same name on node B (failing), then on node B the DFT
  entry corresponding to X (for node A) disappears.
