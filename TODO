- flow entries in ALLOCATED state but never associated to a file descriptor
  with a bind operation should disappear after a while, otherwise we
  have leakage

- rlite-utils: deserialization routines should check lengths

- CDAP: support a simple retransmission mechanism, in case the CDAP
  connection is not supported by a reliable flow

- support generic RIB M_READ (and M_WRITE)

- BUG (normal): if name X is registered on node A, and someone tries to
  register the same name on node B (failing), then on node B the DFT
  entry corresponding to X (for node A) disappears.

- implement utility to graphically show ipcp-rib-show, using graphviz
  (DIF map with active links)

- install: don't overwrite config files
