- flow entries in ALLOCATED state but never associated to a file descriptor
  with a bind operation should disappear after a while, otherwise we
  have leakage

- rlite-utils: deserialization routines should check lengths

- support generic RIB M_READ (and M_WRITE)

- BUG (normal): if name X is registered on node A, and someone tries to
  register the same name on node B (failing), then on node B the DFT
  entry corresponding to X (for node A) disappears.

- implement utility to graphically show ipcp-rib-show, using graphviz
  (DIF map with active links)

- install: don't overwrite config files

- DTCP: compute RTT and use it to program the RTX timer
- DTCP: implement A timer and coalesced ACKs
- DTCP: check that control rb is not sent twice for each packet (once
  in rl_normal_sdu_rx and once in rl_normal_sdu_rx_consumed).
